      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I don't have background in web development or technology. I want to be a developer because it is a skill that would help me in the modern world and into the future.</p>
      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>My favorite hobby is hiking with friends or family. During my tenure with the Wyoming Conservation Corps I was able to hike and camp across Wyoming and northern Colorado and I came away from that experience with a deep appreciation for and understanding of nature. A newer hobby of mine is baking, I really enjoy the experimentation and precision of tinkering with recipes until they come out just right and I've been working on a method to document my recipes in baker's percentages so I can (hopefully) expect more consistent results in the future. In addition to outdoor activities and baking, I am an avid reader, especially so in the winter months. I most enjoy classics, but I do work a contemporary novel in every now and then. My last completed book is Anna Karenina and come next winter I plan on starting War and Peace. </p>
      <h3>A Proud Moment</h3>
      <p>My proudest achievement is the trail I mainained and upgraded in rotary club park outside of Casper Wyoming. The trail offered numerous technical challenges and the end result was better than I ever would have expected at the beggining of the project. </p>
      <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
      <p>Immediately after the Array School I am hoping to enroll in the Array apprenticeship program to continue learning and developing. A long term goal of mine is to have a job that allows me to work from anywhere so I can travel and keep my own hours.</p>
