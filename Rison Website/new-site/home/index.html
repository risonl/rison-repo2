            <h1>Who is Rison and what are they all about?</h1>
            <p>I am Rison Lain, and this is my website. I am a 21 year old aspiring developer currently enrolled in the Array fall 2021 bootcamp. My hobbies include cooking and baking, playing video games, and enjoying nature (weather permitting). I have also recently started a small record collection which I hope to grow in the coming years. I don’t have much background in web development yet, but as I grow as a developer you can expect additions and changes to this site reflecting my new skills and interests. After I finish the Array program, I will be sticking around to complete an additional apprenticeship program to build experience in the field. My long-term goal after completing the program is to buy a small property and design my own home from the ground up, including sustainable agriculture and electricity. My proudest achievement is completing over 1,000 hours of community service through the Wyoming Conservation Corps (WCC). The WCC is a program run by Americorps in conjunction with the University of Wyoming which enlists volunteers to do a variety of conservation work on Wyoming’s many public lands. Although I did not pursue a long-term career in conservation, my time spent as a dirty hippy in the woods changed the way I think about the natural and artificial systems that surround us in everyday life. The conservation corps informed so much of who I am today that it’s hard to capture just how important the program was in my life. If you are interested to find out more about me and my journey as a developer, be sure to check out my blog! I plan on posting about my work, my cooking, and anything of interest that comes along the way. Check out my gallery for some neat photos of my time in the WCC and of my cooking, and check back later to see my portfolio grow as I learn more about web development!</p>
